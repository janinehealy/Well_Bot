Mental health problems are probably more common than you think. Approximately 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience one each year.In England, 1 in 6 people report experiencing a common mental health problem (like anxiety and depression) in any given week.
Mental health is on a spectrum – we can be ill and struggling and well and functioning. It constantly changes which can be exhausting, but it’s also a reminder that things will change for the better again.
Looking after your mental health can help you to feel good. It can also help stop some mental health problems from developing, control the effects they have, and stop them from getting worse.
We can all feel sad, worried, angry or fed up at times – like nerves before an exam or feeling down when a friend moves away. But if these feelings last a long time, like if you always feel low or can’t sleep, it might be a sign that you need more help.Medication is reported as the most common type of treatment for a mental health problem.
