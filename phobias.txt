A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder. It is an extreme form of fear or anxiety, triggered by a particular situation or object.
There may be a situation that triggers a phobia. You may know it's safe to be out on a balcony in a high-rise block, but feel terrified to go out on it. You might not even be able to enjoy the view from behind the windows inside the building.
Or there may be an object that triggers a phobia. You may know that a spider isn’t poisonous or that it won’t bite you, but this still doesn’t reduce your anxiety.
You may even feel this extreme anxiety when you think or talk about the situation or object.
Many of us have fears about particular situations or objects. This is perfectly normal. A fear becomes a phobia if: the fear is out of proportion to the danger, it lasts for more than six months and it has a significant impact on how you live your day-to-day life.
